      CONDA is a crowdinvesting platform, which connects entrepreneurs and small
      companies with potential investors, helping them achieve successful
      businesses together.


      So far, 89 projects have been successfully funded, and investment capital
      of more than € 19.60 million was raised via CONDA platforms in Europe.
      Through CONDA’s platform, everyone can invest in a project, with
      investments being as low as €100. Apart from giving everybody the ability
      to participate as an investor, every valid project is given the
      opportunity to get financed through CONDA. 
    question: What is CONDA?
  - answer: >+
      Even though CONDA already is the leader in providing Central Europe with a
      crowd financing technology, it is important to keep developing. Basing the
      crowd financing platform on blockchain will increase the security of the
      platform and also with offering our white-label platform to new users and
      new countries.


      Since the blockchain platform is operating on a single currency, expanding
      the community with investors and companies from new countries will be
      possible without flooding the system with additional fiat currencies.


      The CONDA platform will maintain legal compliance within any new country
      of operation.

    question: >-
      CONDA has already successfully raised investments for over 90 projects.
      Why does it need an ICO? 
  - answer: >-
      Yes, there is a bonus system during the Private- and Pre-Sale.
      Private-Sale investors get 30% bonus token and Pre-Sale investors get 20%
      (plus additional up to 10%, depending on amount invested).


      Please find the detailed scheme in our white paper.
    question: Is there a bonus system during the Private- and Crowd-Sale?
  - answer: >-
      First of all, because you believe in our vision to build the financial
      market of the future by creating a decentralized network of crowdinvesting
      platforms and the ability of our team to realize it. One reason to invest
      in the CRWD Token might be, because you are planning to use the services
      of CONDA in the future and you want the bonus of up to 30% additional CRWD
      Token, which you can get during the Pre-Sale. This would give you more
      CONDA services for less money. Another reason could be that you believe,
      that the value of the CONDA Token will increase over time and a possible
      exchange might be profitable for you.
