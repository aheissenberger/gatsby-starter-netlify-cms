      CONDA is working on erasing geographic and other existing boundaries
      between different currencies and countries. This is possible by
      establishing the lowest and fairest rates for investing across countries
      and currencies. As the investment transactions are quick and easy, the
      investment process should be the same regardless of a user’s currency or
      country.

      In the last couple of years, due to having increasing numbers of
      innovative and rapidly-growing SMEs, startups and real estate projects,
      traditional forms of financing are unable to fit the needs of innovative
      ventures. New and alternative forms of financing are the solution to
      closing the financial gap, with the most important ones being crowdfunding
      or crowdinvesting


      Back in 2013, CONDA took the first step to closing this financial gap by
      creating an innovative crowdinvesting platform that connects companies
      with investors who would help their ideas evolve into profitable business
      without intermediaries, and by participating in the success of these
      businesses.

    quote: >-
      "Alternative business funding increased considerably, with €5,431 million
      raised for over 9,400 start-ups and SMEs across Europe in 2015 – and
      research shows that it will grow even more, globally.*"

      The industry for alternative financing is growing rapidly and with it,
      more different and non-standardized platforms for


      ICOs and crowdfinancing are popping up. CONDA believes that the future of
      financing lies in the power of the crowd. At the moment, the power of the
      crowd is proving to be on a good path toward fulfilling the existing
      financing gap, but it is also obvious that it has much more to overcome,
      such as the lack of decentralization and full-transparency.
