      between different currencies and countries. This is possible by
      establishing the lowest and fairest rates for investing across countries
      and currencies. As the investment transactions are quick and easy, the

crowdinvesting:

      In the last few years, the rapid growth in size and number of innovative
      SMEs, startups, and real estate projects have demonstrated that
      traditional forms of financing are unable to fit the needs of 
      cutting-edge ventures. New and alternative forms of financing are the
      solution to closing the financial gap, with crowdfunding or crowdinvesting
      proving to be the most important.


      CONDA took the first step to closing this financial gap back in 2013 by
      creating an innovative crowdinvesting platform that connects companies
      with investors who help the firms’ ideas evolve into profitable businesses
      without intermediaries who actively participate in the success of these
      businesses. *(Cambridge Centre for Alternative finance, 2016)
    quote: >-
      "Alternative business funding increased considerably, with €5,431 million
      raised for over 9,400 start-ups and SMEs across Europe in 2015 – and
      research shows that it will grow even more, globally.*"
