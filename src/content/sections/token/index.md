quote: The CRWD Token is the core of all transactions made within the CRWD network.

  Without the CRWD Token, no investments can be made via the crowdfinancing

  and selling of investments, and for maintaining all the positive aspects that
  blockchain brings to the table: transparency, security, and decentralization.
