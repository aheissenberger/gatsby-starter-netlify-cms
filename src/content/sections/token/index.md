title2: CRWD Token?
quote: >-
  CRWD Token is the core of all transactions made within the CONDA decentralized
  marketplace.
description: >-
  Without the CRWD Token, no investments can be conducted. As it is, only CRWD
  Token holders will be able to use the crowdfinancing platform. It is also
  mandatory for a successfully buying and selling the investments as well as
  maintaining the positive aspects of the blockchain: transparency, security and
  decentralization.


  The token is required for CONDAâ€™s diverse business services as well as for
  paying the fees thereby incurred. By contrast, investing in the projects
  processed on CONDA is still made in the respective national currency, e.g. in
  Euro.
