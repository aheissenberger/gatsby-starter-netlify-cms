quote: The CRWD Token is the core of all transactions made within the CRWD network.
description: >-
  Without the CRWD Token, no investments can be made via the crowdfinancing
  platform. 


  Because the CRWD Token is needed to participate in the CONDA
  blockchain-supported ecosystem, it is also mandatory for the successful buying
  and selling of investments, and for maintaining all the positive aspects that
  blockchain brings to the table: transparency, security, and decentralization.
