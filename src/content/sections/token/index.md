title2: The CRWD Token
quote: >-
  The CRWD Token is the core of all transactions and acts as fuel to the CRWD
  Network.
description: >-
  Without the CRWD Token, no investments can be made via the crowdfinancing
  platform. 


  Because the CRWD Token is needed to participate in the CONDA
  blockchain-supported network, it is also mandatory for the successful buying
  and selling of investments, and for maintaining all the positive aspects that
  blockchain brings to the table: transparency, security, and decentralization.
