      quote: >-
        "As an entrepreneur, the sound finance of ventures to strengthen the
        Central European business location is an important concern to me and to
        support this mission basis of my participation in the CONDA ICO."

      name: Niko Alm
      quote: >-
        "Current corporate structures are too slow to reflect the demand for
        flexible investments. With an ICO, it's possible to achieve something
        that can be done in a GmbH and an AG only with great effort and
        expense."

      quote: >-
        "The ICO is a propriate vehicle for CONDA to be prepared for future
        developments in the area of blockchain technology on the one hand, and
        to establish market development in new markets on the other hand while
        securing and expanding existing markets."
