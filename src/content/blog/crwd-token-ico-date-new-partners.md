## CONDA – Crowdinvesting platform announces ICO date and introduces new partners

The Austrian crowdinvesting platform CONDA is intensively preparing for its upcoming Initial Coin Offering (ICO), introducing its newest partners: communications expert Jürgen Höbarth, crypto econometrics research engineer Daniel Pichler (RIAT – Institute for Future Cryptoeconomics) and developer Andreas Petersson (Capacity Blockchain Solutions GmbH). CONDA is also releasing the latest schedule for its ICO.

Vienna, March 14, 2018 | Under the guidance of its two Managing Directors, Daniel Horak, and Paul Pöltner, CONDA is actively preparing for its upcoming ICO. The new platform relies upon blockchain infrastructure, and users will thus benefit from the decentralized, secure and transparent nature of the blockchain. The result: CONDA will issue its own cryptocurrency, the CRWD Token – the centerpiece of the new platform and also the basis of future investments on the platform. Users may receive attractive bonus tokens based on their activities.

## New schedule released

Currently, CONDA has entered its private sale phase with a hard cap goal of 1 million Euros. During this stage (until April 1st), early birds can capture a 30 percent bonus! On April 1st CONDA is officially starting the so-called “whitelisting” stage for its pre- and crowd-sale investors. During that stage, investors’ wallets will be registered to enable future transactions. The pre-sale then finally starts on June 4th and is open for a max. of 60 days or until the hardcap of 6 mio EUR reached, followed by the crowd-sale for up to 40 days or until the total hardcap is reached.

## New experts on board

Jürgen Höbarth is an expert for digital communications strategy and storytelling, tokenization evangelist and founder of www.thetokenizationcompany.com, a privately-funded, decentralized blockchain investment & advisory group. Lead by Daniel Pichler, RIAT (www.riat.at) – the Research Institute for Future Cryptoeconomics – jumps on board as a technical & research partner. Together, RIAT and CONDA are establishing a research group in the field of crowd-sales to foster national expertise in blockchain technology and to secure CONDA investors with innovative and secure investment tools. Finally, Andreas Petersson, Managing Director of Capacity Blockchain Solutions GmbH and a skilled developer, joins the new team as a technical advisor.

“Introducing blockchain infrastructure and issuing our own token is the next logical step in the further development of CONDA. Our intention is to set ourselves apart from various dubious offers in the ICO market. That’s why we strive for external expertise with partners that are well-experienced in the field of Initial Coin Offerings“, Managing Partner Paul Pöltner assures.
