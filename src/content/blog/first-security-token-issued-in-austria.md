"_We have chosen this new financial instrument to fundraise for several reasons. When compared to the traditional VC process and the endless hamster wheel of meetings and pitches, a security token can be easily issued to a large number of potential investors and the terms can be defined very flexibly_", explains Florian Wimmer, CEO and co-founder of Blockpit.

Security Token Offerings combine the advantages of traditional corporate financing with blockchain technology and represent an innovative and inexpensive way of accessing growth capital, especially for start-ups and SMEs.

"While 2017 was the year of the ICOs and 2018 the bear market brought the overheated
 expectations back to reality in pain, 2019 is emerging as the year of the STO," says Dr. Christoph Kletzer, Senior Lecturer at King's College London and member of the advisory board of the [Digital Asset Association Austria](https://daaa.at/) (DAAA).

The Security Token (TAX Token) issued by Blockpit gives investors the right to a share
of the future revenue of Blockpit. As this is a private offering further details are available for professional investors on request. A public offering is planned for Q4 2019.

Now itÂ´s time to prepare everything for our next customers using our infrastructure. Stay tuned, updates coming soon!
