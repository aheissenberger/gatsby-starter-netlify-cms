## Welcome to CRWD Network Airdrop!

CONDA is dropping CRWD Tokens for supporting us on our social media channels!

## How does it work?

If you participate in our CRWD Network Airdrop campaign, you receive stakes for the following activities:

\>> 2 stakes

* for a successful whitelisting on [ico.conda.online
  ](https://ico.conda.online/i/whitelist)

\>> 6 stakes

* for signing-up to our [Telegram](https://t.me/conda_ico) channel PLUS 
* inviting 2 additional users, who also sign-up
* Attention: all users must stay until Oct. 31st, 2018

\>> 8 stakes

* following us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/crwdnetwork/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/conda_austria), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/2832940/), [Reddit](https://github.com/conda-ag)

The maximum of possible stakes per participant are therefore 16.



## How do I join?

(1) [Sign-up for the CRWD Network Airdrop](https://goo.gl/forms/It1mE61X66CCWwOt1) here and provide us with your social media profiles (If we can’t find your profiles, we can’t give you tokens).

(2) Follow all our channels:

* [Telegram](https://t.me/conda_ico)

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/conda_austria)
* [Reddit](https://github.com/conda-ag)

(3) Don´t forget to [whitelist here](https://ico.conda.online/i/whitelist)!



## Terms & Conditions

The CRWD Tokens allocated for the airdrop campaign will be issued and transferred after the ICO is completed, to all participants, using a “staking” procedure.

The maximum number of participants for the airdrop campaign is 10.000 user (first come, first serve principle)!

CRWD Tokens will only be airdropped to participants who are successfully whitelisted.

Any Telegram usernames containing advertisements or website addresses will be kicked-out from the group and will not be eligible for airdrop payout, in order to maintain integrity of the community.

Our airdrop campaign is tied to the milestones of our ICO:

* hard cap (22.000.000 USD) reached: 
  1.2% of all token supply will be distributed proportionally via CRWD Network Airdrop to a max. of 160.000 stakes
* hard cap (22.000.000 USD) not reached: 
  1.2% of all token supply will be distributed proportionally via CRWD Network Airdrop to its participant not exceeding 5 Tokens per stake (= max. 80 CRWD Tokens/participant)

If hard cap is not reached and CRWD Tokens allocated for this campaign are left, we are going to announce a 2nd airdrop campaign after the ICO.
