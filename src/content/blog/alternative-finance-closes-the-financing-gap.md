Due to the issues with traditional financing methods, SMEs and startups frequently rely on venture capitalists (VCs) and business angels for investment. While VCs and business angels are increasing in both number and approachability thanks to technology, a financing gap remains.

The figure above presents the current and projected state of raising investments via various methods. Alternative financing is closing a significant gap, reducing pressure on traditional financing models and lending a helping hand to innovative SMEs and startups.

In Europe, the UK leads the way with 94 peer-to-peer lending platforms, followed by France (49) and Germany (35) (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, 2016). Large market potential exists in Central Europe, where the concentration of similar platforms is rather low. However, it is estimated that over $90 billion in investment will flow to these alternative platforms by 2020. Considering current growth rates, this may even be an underestimation (The World Bank, 2013). By now, it should be evident that alternative finance is on the way to become the primary source and method of raising investments.
