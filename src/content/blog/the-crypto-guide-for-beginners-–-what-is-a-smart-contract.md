A smart contract, also referred to as a crypto contract, is a computer protocol that directly controls the transfer of cryptocurrencies or assets between two parties under certain conditions. Like a traditional contract on paper, a smart contract defines rules and penalties around an agreement; however, a crypto contract can automatically enforce the stated obligations because the contracts are stored on the blockchain, a decentralized ledger that underpins cryptocurrencies.



Here is the definition from [cointelegraph.com](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/smart-contracts-explained): “_A smart contract is a special protocol intended to contribute, verify or implement the negotiation or performance of the contract. Smart contracts allow \[individuals] to perform credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible. Smart contracts contain all the information about the contract terms and execute all envisaged actions automatically._”



## So, why do we use smart contracts?

* **Security** A smart contract is encrypted and recorded in the network so that it can’t be changed or get lost.
* **Efficiency**  Most of the processes are automated, and there are no intermediaries in between the two parties.
* **Standardization**  It is possible to choose an existing smart contract and change it to suit your needs.
