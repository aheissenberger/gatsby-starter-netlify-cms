startup300 AG, the operator of an ecosystem for startups and innovative corporates, is taking over CONDA AG, one of the most innovative providers of crowdinvesting platforms and technologies. A corresponding purchase agreement has already been signed, subject to the approval of all committees. The amount of the purchase price, which is partly paid in cash and partly in shares of startup300 AG, was not disclosed. The transaction will take place in several stages and will be completed by the middle of next year with the acquisition of 100 percent of CONDA. Paul Pöltner and Daniel Horak, the founders and board members of CONDA AG, will continue to operate the company as an independent subsidiary of startup300 AG. They will take over additional tasks on strategically relevant topics of startup300 AG as well.

"CONDA has a scalable technology that we will integrate into the startup300 group as a backbone for startup investments. A technology that is used for crowdinvesting but also for alternative financing instruments as well as SaaS/white label solution and investor clubs and that is also ready for a blockchain application with crypto tokens for securities/shares," says Michael Eisler, co-founder and CEO of startup300 AG.

"In recent years, with CONDA, we have not only built a European-wide network of digital platforms and communities for alternative financing of innovative ideas, but also developed specific products that can map future financing instruments with technologies such as blockchain. We want to further accelerate this development. The cooperation with the startup300 ecosystem is an obvious choice," says Daniel Horak, co-founder and CEO of CONDA AG.

## Vision: More Private Venture Capital for Startups



The joint vision of both companies is to increase the access to private risk capital for the financing of innovative growth companies in the next few years and to professionalize the support for founding start-ups. This is an essential requirement for developing more and more successful startups from Austria. "Of what we see today, crowdinvesting is just a small part of a funding chain for startups. From first prize money - such as a startup live program - to venture capital funds such as capital300 or Speedinvest, it needs a solid pillar of business angels and the crowd. We want to build a continuous chain of financing in order to build the companies of the future in an amount that is necessary to not lose the international connection, "says Michael Eisler, co-founder and CEO of startup300 AG.

Last year, startup300 AG focused on establishing the basis for an Austria-wide ecosystem that enables start-ups and innovative corporates to have access to innovation rooms, business angels, events, training and established companies, etc. CONDA AG has not only built the most successful Austrian platform for crowdinvesting in the DACH and CEE region; the team led by Paul Pöltner and Daniel Horak has also developed the technological foundations as well as a deep understanding of the regulatory framework for the execution of corporate finance, which can go far beyond the currently known amount of crowdinvesting. The product range of CONDA includes white label solutions as well as the technical implementation of security and equity token offerings.

The combination of the know-how developed in the two companies and the linking of previously developed services promises an enormous potential. Those synergies can be developed due to a closer cooperation on a company level.
