Spread the word and contribute to our efforts in developing a decentralized network protocol for issuing and managing tokenized equity offerings, and earn CRWD Token in return!

## CRWD Token Distribution

* **20% content creation campaign**
* 40% for referral campaign - coming soon
* 40% airdrop campaign - coming soon

_
CONDA reserves the right to change bounty campaign rules at any time - the changes will be shown on official ICO website and Bitcointalk.

## Content Creation Campaign

All participants will create content which will be scored. Based upon their relative participation in total score for the week they will receive **bounty share equal to the relative percentage of week's award**. 

A bounty share is a part of the total bounty amount. Participants will get stakes on a weekly basis during the campaign. **The weekly score will be reset at the beginning of every week.** At the end of each week, posts are evaluated, the score is calculated and recorded. At the end of the campaign, each participants amount of bounty tokens will be calculated according to the amount of bounty stakes received.
