**The crowd is the core of our business and once again, we address it while welcoming everyone to participate in our bounty program.**

Spread the word and contribute to our efforts in developing a decentralized network protocol for issuing and managing tokenized equity offerings, and earn CRWD Token in return!

## 

## CRWD Token Distribution

CONDA will create up-to 45,000,000 CRWD Tokens wherein 3% are reserved for the entire bounty program, which will be distributed between:

* **20% content creation & social media campaign**
* 40% for [referral program](https://ico.conda.online/crwd-network-referral-program/)
* 40% [airdrop campaign](https://ico.conda.online/crwd-network-airdrop/)

_CONDA reserves the right to change bounty campaign rules at any time - the changes will be shown on official ICO website and Bitcointalk._

## Content Creation & Social Media Campaign

All participants will create content which will be scored. 

⇒ Please feel free to create your own unique content, the more creative the better!

Based upon their relative participation in total score for a period of 10 days, they will receive **bounty share equal to the relative percentage of week's award**. 

A bounty share is a part of the total bounty amount. Participants will get stakes on a 10-day basis during the campaign. **The score for the 10 days will be reset at the beginning of every week.** At the end of each week, posts are evaluated, the score is calculated and recorded. At the end of the campaign, each participants amount of bounty tokens will be calculated according to the amount of bounty stakes received.
